In this problem, you are given an array C of size N. The goal is to arrange the elements of the array in a circle in a clockwise manner. To achieve this, you can perform two types of operations:

1. Operation 1: Select two adjacent elements X and Y and replace them with X || Y, which represents the bitwise OR operation.
2. Operation 2: Select two adjacent elements X and Y and replace them with X && Y, which represents the bitwise AND operation.

You can perform a total of (N-2) operations of either type. After performing these operations, you need to find the maximum possible difference between the two remaining elements in the array.

To solve this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Read the number of test cases, T.
2. For each test case:
   a. Read the size of the array, N.
   b. Read the elements of the array, C.
   c. Perform the operations as described:
      - Iterate (N-2) times.
      - For each iteration, select two adjacent elements and perform either Operation 1 or Operation 2.
   d. Calculate the difference between the two remaining elements.
   e. Output the maximum difference for the current test case.

The goal is to determine the maximum difference that can be achieved by strategically performing the given operations on the array elements. The operations modify the array in a way that maximizes the difference between the remaining elements
