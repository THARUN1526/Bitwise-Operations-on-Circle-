 Let's break down the algorithm step by step:

1. Read the number of test cases.

2. For each test case:
   a. Read the value of 'n' and a list 'L' containing 'n' integers.
   b. Initialize 'a' as the first element of 'L' and 'j' as the last element of 'L'.
   c. Create two empty lists, 'susL' and 'susL2', to store suspicious values.
   d. Initialize 'x' and 'y' as 0.
   e. Iterate over the range from 0 to 'n-2' (exclusive):
      - Check if the bitwise AND of 'a' and 'L[i]' is less than 'a' and the bitwise OR of 'x' and 'L[i]' is greater than 'x'.
      - If the condition is satisfied, append 'L[i]' to 'susL' and continue.
      - Otherwise, update 'a' by performing the bitwise AND with 'L[i]' and update 'x' by performing the bitwise OR with 'L[i]'.
   f. Iterate over the range from 2 to 'n' (exclusive):
      - Check if the bitwise AND of 'j' and 'L[i]' is less than 'j' and the bitwise OR of 'y' and 'L[i]' is greater than 'y'.
      - If the condition is satisfied, append 'L[i]' to 'susL2' and continue.
      - Otherwise, update 'j' by performing the bitwise AND with 'L[i]' and update 'y' by performing the bitwise OR with 'L[i]'.
   g. Process the elements in 'susL' and 'susL2':
      - For each element 'i' in 'susL':
        - Calculate 'temp' as the bitwise AND of 'a' and 'i'.
        - Calculate 'temp2' as the bitwise OR of 'x' and 'i'.
        - Calculate 'check' as 'a' minus 'temp'.
        - Calculate 'check2' as 'temp2' minus 'x'.
        - If 'check' is greater than or equal to 'check2', update 'a' with 'temp'.
        - Otherwise, update 'x' with 'temp2'.
      - For each element 'i' in 'susL2':
        - Calculate 'temp' as the bitwise AND of 'j' and 'i'.
        - Calculate 'temp2' as the bitwise OR of 'y' and 'i'.
        - Calculate 'check' as 'j' minus 'temp'.
        - Calculate 'check2' as 'temp2' minus 'y'.
        - If 'check' is greater than or equal to 'check2', update 'j' with 'temp'.
        - Otherwise, update 'y' with 'temp2'.
   h. Print the maximum value between 'x-a' and 'y-j'.

The algorithm processes the list 'L' in two parts: the elements from the beginning up to the second-to-last element ('a' and 'x'), and the elements from the second element to the end ('j' and 'y'). It identifies suspicious elements by checking if their bitwise AND and bitwise OR operations can change the values of 'a' and 'x' or 'j' and 'y', respectively.

Finally, it calculates the maximum difference between 'x-a' and 'y-j' and prints the result.
